# Update Project Action

A composite GitHub action that updates or gets an item's fields on a GitHub Projects (beta) board based on a workflow dispatch (or other) event's input.

[![CI](https://github.com/benbalter/update-project-action/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/benbalter/update-project-action/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

## Goals 

* To make it easier to update/read the fields of a GitHub Project board based on action taken elsewhere within the development process (e.g., status update comments)
* Keep it simple - Prefer boring technology that others can understand, modify, and contribute to
* Never force a human to do what a robot can

## Status

Used to automate non-production workflows.

## Usage

To use this composite GitHub Action, add the following to a YAML file in your repository's `.github/workflows/` directory, customizing the `with` section following [the instructions in the Inputs section](#inputs) below:

```yml
name: Update status on project board
on:
  repository_dispatch:
    types: [status_update]
jobs:
  update_project:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Read status
        id: read_status
        uses: github/update-project-action@v3
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.STATUS_UPDATE_TOKEN }}
          organization: github
          project_number: 1234
          operation: read
          content_id: ${{ github.event.client_payload.command.resource.id }}
      - name: Output status
        run: |
          echo "Current status value: ${{ steps.read_status.outputs.field_read_value }}"
      - name: Update status
        id: update_status
        uses: github/update-project-action@v3
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.STATUS_UPDATE_TOKEN }}
          organization: github
          project_number: 1234
          content_id: ${{ github.event.client_payload.command.resource.id }}
          field: Status
          value: ${{ github.event.client_payload.data.status }}
```

*Note: The above step can be repeated multiple times in a given job to update multiple fields on the same or different projects.* 

#### Example: Update project status when issue is assigned

When using the `issues` trigger with `assigned` event, you may want to automatically add the issue to a project and set its status:

```yml
name: Update assigned issues in project

on:
  issues:
    types: [assigned]

jobs:
  update-project-status:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Update status
        uses: github/update-project-action@v2
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.ACTIONS_TOKEN }}
          organization: webrecorder
          project_number: 9
          content_id: ${{ github.event.issue.node_id }}
          field: Status
          value: Todo
          auto_add: true  # Automatically add issue to project if not already in it
```

### Roadmap

The Action is largely feature complete with regards to its initial goals. Find a bug or have a feature request? [Open an issue](https://github.com/benbalter/update-project-action/issues), or better yet, submit a pull request - contribution welcome!

### Inputs

* `content_id` - The global ID of the issue or pull request within the project
* `field` - The field on the project to set the value of
* `github_token` - A GitHub Token with access to both the source issue and the destination project (`repo` and `write:org` scopes)
* `operation` - Operation type (update or read)
* `organization` - The organization that contains the project, defaults to the current repository owner
* `project_number` - The project number from the project's URL
* `value` - The value to set the project field to. Only required for operation type read
* `auto_add` - Automatically add the issue or pull request to the project if it's not already in it (default: false)

### Outputs

* `field_id` - The global ID of the field
* `field_read_value` - The value of the field before the update
* `field_type` - The updated field's ProjectV2FieldType (text, single_select, number, date, or iteration)
* `field_updated_value` - The value of the field after the update
* `item_id` - The global ID of the issue or pull request
* `item_title` - The title of the issue or pull request
* `option_id` - The global ID of the selected option
* `project_id` - The global ID of the project

### V1 vs V2

In June 2022, [GitHub announced a breaking change to the Projects API](https://github.blog/changelog/2022-06-23-the-new-github-issues-june-23rd-update/). As such, the `@v1` tag of this action will ceased working on October 1st, 2022.  You can upgrade to the `@v2` tag (by updating the reference in your Workflow file) at any time.
